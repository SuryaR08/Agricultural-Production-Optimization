# Agricultural Production Optimization



Agricultural Production Optimization is a data-driven project that aims to predict the best crop to grow based on the current climatic conditions. By analyzing various environmental factors such as minerals, humidity, temperature, pH level, and rainfall, the project provides recommendations to optimize agricultural production.

## Dataset

The project utilizes an open-source dataset that contains a collection of agricultural data. The dataset consists of multiple columns, including:

- Minerals -(Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium)
- Humidity
- Temperature
- pH level
- Rainfall
- Crop types

The dataset is uploaded to the [dataset](https://github.com/SuryaR08/Agricultural-Production-Optimization/tree/main/data.csv) directory of this repository.

## Methodology

The project was implemented using Jupyter Notebook and Python programming language. Here is an overview of the methodology:

1. Data preprocessing: The dataset was cleaned and transformed to ensure accurate and meaningful analysis. This involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and normalizing the data.

2. Exploratory data analysis: Various statistical techniques and visualizations were employed to gain insights into the relationships between different variables. This step helped in understanding the data distribution and identifying patterns.

3. Feature selection: Relevant features were selected based on their impact on crop prediction. This involved evaluating the correlation between variables and identifying the most influential factors.

4. Model training: Machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees, random forests, or neural networks, were used to train a predictive model. The dataset was split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

5. Model evaluation: The trained model was evaluated using appropriate metrics to measure its accuracy and generalization capability. Cross-validation techniques, such as k-fold validation, were applied to ensure robustness.

6. Crop prediction: Given the current climatic conditions, the optimized model predicts the most suitable crop to grow. This prediction can help farmers make informed decisions about their agricultural practices.

## Usage

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SuryaR08/Agricultural-Production-Optimization.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies. Assuming you have Python and pip installed, run the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Open the `agricultural_production_optimization.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.

5. Execute the notebook cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis, train the model, and predict the best crop for the current climatic conditions.

## Results

The Agricultural Production Optimization project provides valuable insights and recommendations for crop selection based on the given climatic conditions. By leveraging the power of data analysis and machine learning, farmers can enhance their agricultural practices and maximize their production output.
